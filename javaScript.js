    Three Game Variables for Rock, Paper, Scissors
    Two Variables for User and CPU: Score and Choice
    
    #Program Starts
    Game loops 5 times.
        CPU randomly chooses one of three Game Variables
        
        User chooses Game variable via String
            Convert to lower-case string.
            Compare to three game variables.
            None match? Repeat 'till valid user input.

        Print Who Chose What

        Compare CPU to User Choice.
            If CPU Choice != User Choice
                Compare all plausible CPU win conditions
