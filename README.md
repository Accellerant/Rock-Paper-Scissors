Goals:
    Utilize basic JavaScript to make a simple game of
    rock, paper, scissors. This iteration will NOT
    have a UI and will rely on the console/alerts to
    display what's going on. 

    This code will be reused for adding a UI to it later.


#UI-Update    3/16/2022
    Add a simple UI to interact with the game instead of
    inputting selections via user input. The score will
    also be shown, as well as what each side plays.
